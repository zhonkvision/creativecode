**False Earth** is an interactive WebGPU experience that continues the journey of [Drift](https://github.com/momentchan/drift) - presenting a continuous landscape generated in real time through GPU-based simulations.



Set after the long drift through space, the project follows an astronaut who arrives on a surface that resembles Earth, yet does not behave like one. As the astronaut moves forward, the ground responds and transforms, leaving visible traces across an endless field. Rather than telling a story through words, the experience unfolds through motion and change—where distance never closes and the environment reveals its nature only through interaction. By navigating this unfamiliar terrain, visitors encounter a world that appears stable at first glance, but gradually exposes uncertain form.

Built with React Three Fiber and Three.js WebGPU (TSL): GPU-computed grass, procedural terrain, VAT roses, and a playable character.

## Features

- **WebGPU grass**: Compute shaders (TSL) for blade position, Voronoi clumping, wind, terrain sampling, and character push
- **Stable, tile-free pattern**: PCG hash for jitter and seeds (no `sin`/`mod`), CPU grid index for stable snapping
- **LOD**: Distance-based LOD with configurable segment counts and draw buffers
- **Procedural terrain**: FBM-based height and normals sampled in compute
- **VAT roses**: Vertex Animation Texture roses with LOD and compute-driven spawn/update
- **Character**: Third-person character with camera modes (Follow / FPV / Detached), grass push interaction
- **Cosmic beams**: Animated beam effects in a separate scene
- **Post-processing**: TSL pipeline with Bloom, DoF, SMAA; PerformanceMonitor for adaptive DPR

## Tech Stack

- **React Three Fiber** – React renderer for Three.js
- **Three.js WebGPU** – WebGPU renderer and backend
- **TSL (Three Shading Language)** – Compute and vertex/fragment in TypeScript (no raw GLSL for grass)
- **Vite** – Build and dev server
- **Leva** – Debug controls
- **Zustand** – Game state (camera, character, WebGPU error, etc.)
- **r3f-perf** – Performance monitoring and DPR scaling

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run dev    # HTTPS dev server
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Key Components

- **Grass**: Compute writes packed per-blade data (position, width/height/bend, rotation, normal, push); material reads only that buffer and builds Bezier blades. Grid snapping uses one blade spacing; CPU passes `uGridIndex` for stable seeds.
- **Terrain**: FBM height and normals; sampled in grass compute and applied to blade bases.
- **Rose**: VAT playback with compute for spawn, lifecycle, and LOD routing.
- **Effects**: TSL post pass combining main scene + beam scene (Bloom, DoF, SMAA).

## Development

- **TypeScript** throughout
- **TSL** for all grass and effects shaders (no `vite-plugin-glsl` for grass)
- **HTTPS** for dev (required for WebGPU in many environments)
- **Path alias**: `@packages/*` for shared packages
